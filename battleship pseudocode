//10x10 grid
//create a count for torpedos
//randomize location of battleships - stay in hidden (5 battleships to randomize that are one peg)
//indicate location that was hit with torpedo - example being A1 if hit now turn to red - once hit you cant hit again
// once all 5 are hit - WE WIN - if count is 5 no more tries
//if you hit 25 and no hits you loose - and reveal where ships are located (conditional rendering?)
